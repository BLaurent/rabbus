## About OmniBus

OmniBus is a basic "service bus" implementation for NodeJS, built on top of
RabbitMQ with the Wascally library to manage RabbitMQ. The service bus
implementation is basic, but includes several of the most common patterns:

* Send / Receive
* Publish / Subscribe
* Request / Response
